# EMCR Brain Sciences Network Strategic Plan

| Vision           | To shape the future of Australian brain science by empowering the next generation of leaders                                                                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mission**      | To support emerging brain scientists in Australia and foster interdisciplinary research from discovery to development and translation.                                                           |
| **Values**       | To promote *diversity, inclusivity, engagement, collaboration and integrity* across Australian brain science                                                                                     |
| **Stakeholders** | Early-to-mid career researchers in brain science in all sectors (\<15 years since PhD, excluding interruptions).                                                                                 |
|                  | Australian Brain Alliance; Australian Academy of Science; Brain Science EMCR groups; Australian Universities, Research Institutes, Government and Funding Bodies; Media, Industry and the Public |

| **Imperatives **  | Fostering a vibrant, diverse, innovative and interdisciplinary network that supports EMCRs in the brain sciences | Providing a platform that breaks down existing structural barriers between the brain science disciplines from discovery to technology and translation | Shaping the national policy relevant to brain science, advocate for EMCRs, and provide the tools for EMCRs to advocate for themselves |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Initiatives** | Inclusion of unrepresented groups on the EMCR BSN Steering Committee| Create opportunities to extend national and international networks by collaborating with other brain science EMCR organisations   | Facilitate broad consultation to identify the needs of our members|
|| Identify strategies to directly address the broader issues of diversity and representation | Enable exchanges between industry and academia | Represent our members on issues raised by stakeholders|
|| Maintain and create opportunities to grow our online symposia series and social media presence |        | Empower EMCRs within brain science to advocate to government and within the workplace|
||---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Outcomes**    | An internationally leading and innovative brain sciences sector for EMCRs in Australia                           | A strong collaborative brain science network bridging disciplines to accelerate discovery and translation                                           | National policy on brain science shaped by and for EMCRs                                                                            |

| Long-term Goal | A vibrant, world-class brain science sector in Australia, championed by EMCRs. |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|                |                                                                                |
