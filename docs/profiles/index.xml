      <description>Dr Mary Ardren is an early career research fellow at the Bionics Institute and holds an honorary appointment at the Medical Bionics Department at The University of Melbourne. Her research involves using electrical and optical stimulation of peripheral nerves to manage chronic health conditions (e.g., chronic pain). She is particularly interested in how pain signalling is altered in the periphery during disease/disorder states, and how this alters central nervous system activity. Her expertise lies in cellular and sensory neuroscience, electrophysiology and optogenetics.</description>

      <guid>/profiles/dr-heidi-waldken/</guid>
      <description>Dr Walkden’s research identified a new path by which bacteria can move from the nasal cavity to the brain and spinal cord, all within 24 hours.  She has also shown that an injury to the inside of the nasal cavity can increase the bacterial invasion of the brain via the nose-to-brain pathway. Alongside her research, Dr Walkden is also an award-winning science communicator. She has won numerous awards for her oral presentations, scientific photos, and poster prizes. Notably, she reached the grand final of the International Asia-Pacific Three Minute Thesis (3MT) Competition in 2017.</description>
