## EMCR Brain Sciences Website

At the moment, this site mainly contains content migrated from the site originally hosted by the [Academy of Sciences](https://www.science.org.au/supporting-science/early-and-mid-career-researchers-0/emcrs/emcr-brain-science-network). We will soon be adding updated content!
