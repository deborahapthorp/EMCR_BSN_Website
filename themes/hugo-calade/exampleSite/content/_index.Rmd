The Early- and Mid-Career Researcher (EMCR) Brain Science Network aims to establish a platform for early-to-mid career brain scientists to develop into future leaders and to drive Australian brain science forward.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("djnavarro/caladown")
```

Once the caladown package is installed, the tutorial in the [posts](/post/) section of this site will walk you through the rest of the process. For folks who already know what they are doing, here's the quick guide to setting up a Hugodown site on GitHub Pages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hugodown::hugo_install("0.66.0") 
caladown::create_hugodown_calade("my-caladown-site")
hugodown::hugo_build(dest = "docs")
usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github() # then enable GH Pages with /docs folder
```
Note that there is a known issue with knitting the R markdown files for some versions of pandoc: at present the earliest known version that works is pandoc 2.1
