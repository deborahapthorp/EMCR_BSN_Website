<h2><a href="https://www.acns.org.au/ecr/">Australasian Cognitive Neuroscience Society (ACNS)</a></h2>
<p>The Australasian Cognitive Neuroscience Society is an academic society focused on the scientific study of the biological or brain foundations of mental processes and behaviour. We welcome members from disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, neurology, linguistics, computer science, and philosophy, all with an interest in the relationships between the brain, mind, and behaviour.</p>
<p>The ACNS Early Career Researcher (ECR) sub-committee is comprised of PhDs and Post-Doctoral representatives at varying stages of their career. The aims of the ECR sub-committee are to develop and promote a supportive early career research community, and provide representation within the society. The sub-committee also hopes to provide a forum for discussing issues relevant to ECRs and support community members to have a successful and enjoyable start to their research careers.</p>
