The EMCR Brain Science Network was established in December of 2017 with the help of seed funding from the [Theo Murphy Initiative](https://www.science.org.au/supporting-science/awards-and-opportunities/theo-murphy-initiative-australia).


## About the EMCR Brain Science Network

The EMCR Brain Science Network is an initiative of the Australian Academy of Science and the [Australian Brain Alliance](https://www.brainalliance.org.au/) that aims to establish a platform for early-to-mid career brain scientists to develop into future leaders and to drive Australian brain science forward. [Visit their page](https://www.brainalliance.org.au/emcr-brain-science-network) to read more about this initiative.

## Membership

Membership of the EMCR Brain Science Network is open for all early-to-mid career researchers (less than 15 years since PhD was awarded, excluding interruptions), PhD students and general public with an interest in brain science.

If you have an interest in general EMCR issues, we encourage you to also become a member of the [EMCR Forum](https://www.science.org.au/supporting-science/early-and-mid-career-researchers-0/emcrs/emcr-membership-registration).
