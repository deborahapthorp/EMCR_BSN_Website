summary: "Dr Sokolenko is a research coordinator and lecturer at the University of Adelaide. She has a particular interest in exploring differences in the electrical activity of the brain underlying cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders. Elysia is currently the local site coordinator for a national trial using transcranial magnetic stimulation in autism. She is also leading the design of a research skills development program in the University of Adelaide’s Bachelor of Medical Studies/Doctor of Medicine."

<p>I completed a PhD at the University of Melbourne in 2019 exploring the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. More specifically, I examined whether there is a causal relationship between disruptions to oscillatory electrical activity in the brain and working memory impairment in the disorder. Through this project, I developed expertise in a number of pre-clinical and laboratory-based skills, including awake in vivo electrophysiology recordings and rodent behavioural testing.</p>
<p>I have since transferred these skills to the clinical context, currently acting as a research coordinator in Adelaide Medical School’s Discipline of Psychiatry. I am the local site coordinator for a nation-wide clinical trial assessing whether a novel type of non-invasive brain stimulation could help people on the autism spectrum. For additional details, see the <a href="https://www.tmsautism.com">study website</a>.</p>
<p>I have a keen interest in exploring how differences in the electrical activity of the brain underlie the symptoms of psychiatric disorders and the often associated cognitive impairment.</p>
