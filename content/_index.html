<p>The goal of calade and caladown is to allow R users to create lightweight websites powered by Hugo and is designed to be compatible with both <a href="https://hugodown.r-lib.org/">hugodown</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>, and allows users to generate graphics that match the visual style of the site via the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/">thematic</a> package. There are two components to caladown, a <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/hugo-calade">Hugo theme</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/caladown">R package</a>. The simplest way to get started is simply to download the R package from GitHub using the following command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_github(&quot;djnavarro/caladown&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Once the caladown package is installed, the tutorial in the <a href="/post/">posts</a> section of this site will walk you through the rest of the process. For folks who already know what they are doing, hereâ€™s the quick guide to setting up a Hugodown site on GitHub Pages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hugodown::hugo_install(&quot;0.66.0&quot;) 
caladown::create_hugodown_calade(&quot;my-caladown-site&quot;)
hugodown::hugo_build(dest = &quot;docs&quot;)
usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github() # then enable GH Pages with /docs folder</code></pre>
<p>Note that there is a known issue with knitting the R markdown files for some versions of pandoc: at present the earliest known version that works is pandoc 2.1</p>
